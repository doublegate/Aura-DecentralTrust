# Aura To-Do Tracking System

This directory contains all task tracking and planning documents for the Aura DecentralTrust project.

## Structure

### Core Documents
- **[MASTER_TODO.md](./MASTER_TODO.md)** - Complete project task list and status
- **[IMMEDIATE_NEXT_STEPS.md](./IMMEDIATE_NEXT_STEPS.md)** - Tasks for this week/month
- **[PHASE2_PLANNING.md](./PHASE2_PLANNING.md)** - Detailed Phase 2 roadmap
- **[DESKTOP_WALLET_MVP.md](./DESKTOP_WALLET_MVP.md)** - Desktop wallet implementation plan

### How It Works
1. All tasks are tracked in markdown files for version control
2. Claude Code automatically updates these files as work progresses
3. Each file focuses on a specific aspect or timeline
4. Use checkboxes for task tracking

### Task Categories
- ‚úÖ **Completed** - Finished tasks
- üîÑ **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- üìã **Upcoming** - Planned but not started
- ‚ùå **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies
- üîß **Technical Debt** - Improvements needed

### Adding New Tasks
When adding new work items:
1. Update the relevant file
2. Add to MASTER_TODO.md if significant
3. Create new planning docs for major features
4. Keep status current

### Review Schedule
- **Daily**: IMMEDIATE_NEXT_STEPS.md
- **Weekly**: MASTER_TODO.md
- **Monthly**: All planning documents
- **Quarterly**: Strategic review
