## Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready for Git Push)
1. Commit all v0.1.5 changes
2. Create and push v0.1.5 tag for release build
3. Update memory locations with session summary

### Phase 1 Completion (5% Remaining)
1. **API-Blockchain Integration** (1-2 days)
2. **P2P Message Handlers** (2-3 days)
3. **Desktop Wallet MVP** (2-4 weeks)

Total estimated time: 10-17 days

## Important Development Note

Going forward, tests should be written alongside new features rather than as a separate phase. This ensures:
- Better code quality from the start
- Immediate validation of functionality
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Continuous integration compliance

## Session Metrics
- **Tests Added**: 53 (bringing total from 452 to 505)
- **Files Modified**: 15+ (version updates, documentation)
- **CI/CD Status**: All checks passing
- **Documentation**: 3 new files, 5+ updated files

## Conclusion

Version 0.1.5 represents a major milestone in test coverage and code quality. The project now has a solid foundation of automated tests that ensure reliability across all platforms. With 95% of Phase 1 complete, the remaining work involves connecting the mock implementations to real blockchain operations and building the desktop wallet interface.
