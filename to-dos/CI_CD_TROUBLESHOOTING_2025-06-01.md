# CI/CD Troubleshooting Session - 2025-06-01

## Summary
We've been working to get the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline running successfully. Here's what we've done and what might still need attention.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Code Quality Issues
- ✅ Fixed all formatting issues with `cargo fmt`
- ✅ Fixed clippy warnings:
  - Removed redundant closures
  - Fixed unnecessary clones on Copy types
  - Added Default implementations
  - Fixed deref issues
  - Refactored function with too many arguments

### 2. CI Configuration Changes
- ✅ Removed system RocksDB dependencies
- ✅ Switched to bundled RocksDB to avoid version conflicts
- ✅ Kept only clang as a build dependency

## Current Status
The CI is still failing, but we've made significant progress. The failures appear to be related to:

1. **RocksDB Linking**: Ubuntu's system RocksDB is too old
2. **Build Time**: Bundled RocksDB takes longer to compile

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Continue with Bundled RocksDB
The current approach (using bundled RocksDB) should work but may need:
- Increased timeout for builds
- More build dependencies (cmake, etc.)

### Option 2: Pin to Specific RocksDB Version
Consider using a specific RocksDB version that's compatible with Ubuntu's packages:
```toml
[dependencies]
rocksdb = { version = "0.21", default-features = false }
```

### Option 3: Use Docker/Container for CI
Create a consistent build environment:
```yaml
container:
  image: rust:latest
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check the CI logs directly**:
   ```
   https://github.com/doublegate/Aura-DecentralTrust/actions
   ```

2. **If build dependencies are missing**, add:
   ```yaml
   sudo apt-get install -y cmake build-essential
   ```

3. **If timeouts are occurring**, increase:
   - Build cache timeouts
   - Test timeouts

4. **Consider simplifying**:
   - Remove macOS from CI matrix temporarily
   - Focus on getting Ubuntu working first

## Local Testing
Everything works perfectly locally with your environment setup:
```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

The issue is specifically with the CI environment having different library versions than your local setup.
