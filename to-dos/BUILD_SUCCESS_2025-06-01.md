# Build Success Summary - 2025-06-01

## Overview
Successfully resolved all build issues and achieved a clean release build of the Aura DecentralTrust project.

## Build Environment Fix
- **Issue**: libclang shared library not found during rust-rocksdb compilation
- **Root Cause**: GCC 15 has stricter C++ header requirements
- **Solution**: 
  - Installed clang packages: `clang-libs` and `clang-devel`
  - Set CXXFLAGS permanently: `-std=c++17 -include cstdint`
  - Configured in both `~/.bashrc` and `~/.cargo/config.toml`

## Build Results
- ✅ Debug build successful: `cargo build --bin aura-node`
- ✅ Release build successful: `cargo build --release` (3m 16s)
- ✅ All workspace members compiled without errors
- ⚠️ One minor warning: unused `build_acceptor` method in TLS module

## Testing Summary
All release binaries tested successfully:

1. **Binary Execution**
   - Help output works correctly
   - All CLI options documented

2. **Node Functionality**
   - Starts cleanly on default ports (P2P: 9000, API: 8080)
   - Proper logging with tracing framework
   - Network peer ID generated correctly

3. **Security Features**
   - JWT authentication fully functional
   - Protected endpoints require valid Bearer tokens
   - TLS/HTTPS mode works with self-signed certificates
   - Proper error responses for unauthorized requests

## Next Steps
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Create Docker/Podman container images
- Begin desktop wallet UI development
- Implement remaining P2P network features

## Technical Notes
- Using `rocksdb` crate v0.23.0 (not rust-rocksdb)
- System no longer requires external RocksDB installation
- CXXFLAGS workaround needed for GCC 15 compatibility
- All dependencies updated to latest versions as of 2025-05-31
