## Problems Solved During the Session

### 1. **Compilation Errors**
- **Issue**: Multiple undefined type errors when implementing new security features
- **Solution**: Added proper imports and created missing type definitions
- **Result**: All modules compile successfully

### 2. **Integration Challenges**
- **Issue**: New security modules needed to integrate with existing architecture
- **Solution**: Created proper abstraction layers and used Arc<Mutex<>> for shared state
- **Result**: Seamless integration with existing codebase

### 3. **Feature Compatibility**
