**Goal**: Make Aura accessible to developers in multiple languages

#### Priority Order:
1. **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK** (2 months)
   - [ ] Core functionality wrapper
   - [ ] Browser compatibility
   - [ ] React components
   - [ ] Example applications

2. **Python SDK** (2 months)

   - [ ] Wallet functionality
   - [ ] Django integration
   - [ ] Jupyter notebooks

3. **Go SDK** (2 months)
   - [ ] Native implementation
   - [ ] gRPC support
   - [ ] Microservice examples
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Milestone 4: Network Infrastructure (Ongoing)
**Goal**: Build robust, scalable network

#### Components:
1. **Testnet** (Month 1-2)
   - [ ] Deploy genesis validators
   - [ ] Create faucet
   - [ ] Monitor network health
   - [ ] Regular resets

2. **Block Explorer** (Month 3-4)
   - [ ] Transaction viewer
   - [ ] DID resolver
   - [ ] Network statistics
   - [ ] API endpoints

3. **Monitoring** (Month 5-6)

   - [ ] Grafana dashboards
   - [ ] Alert system
   - [ ] Performance tracking

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 2 Blockchain developers (consensus)
- 2 Cryptography engineers (ZKP)
- 3 SDK developers (multi-language)
- 1 DevOps engineer
- 1 Technical writer

### Infrastructure
- Testnet servers (minimum 5 nodes)
- Monitoring infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation hosting

### Budget Estimates
- Development: $1.2M - $1.8M
- Infrastructure: $50K - $100K/year
- Audits: $100K - $200K
- Marketing/Community: $200K - $300K

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **PoS Transition**
   - Risk: Chain halt during transition
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, gradual rollout

2. **ZKP Performance**
   - Risk: Proof generation too slow
   - Mitigation: Circuit optimization, hardware acceleration

3. **SDK Compatibility**
   - Risk: Breaking changes
   - Mitigation: Semantic versioning, deprecation policy

### Market Risks
1. **Adoption**
   - Risk: Slow developer adoption
   - Mitigation: Hackathons, grants, partnerships

2. **Competition**
   - Risk: Other SSI solutions
   - Mitigation: Focus on unique features, interoperability

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- PoS running with 50+ validators
- ZKP generation < 1 second
- SDK downloads > 10K/month
- 99.9% network uptime

### Ecosystem Metrics
- 100+ applications built
- 10K+ active DIDs
- 1M+ credentials issued
- 5+ enterprise partnerships

## Next Steps
1. Form Phase 2 development team
2. Secure funding
3. Set up project management
4. Begin PoS research
5. Community announcement
