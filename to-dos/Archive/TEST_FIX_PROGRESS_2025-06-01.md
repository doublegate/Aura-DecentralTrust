# Test Fix Progress Report - December 1, 2025

## Session Summary

Fixed all compilation issues in aura-ledger tests and continued adding comprehensive test coverage.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed aura-ledger Test Compilation Issues ✅

#### Type Fixes:
- Updated `DidDocument` creation to use the `new()` method instead of direct struct initialization
- Fixed `CredentialSchema` structure to match actual definition (added `author`, `created`, `schema` fields)
- Added `PartialEq` and `Eq` derives to `BlockNumber` and `TransactionId` in aura-common
- Fixed timestamp comparisons to use `.as_unix()` instead of accessing internal field
- Made `TransactionForSigning` public for use in tests

#### Dependency Fixes:
- Added `tempfile = "3.8"` as dev-dependency to aura-ledger/Cargo.toml

#### Consensus Test Fixes:
- Fixed validator rotation tests by adding deterministic sorting to `get_block_validator()`
- Updated all consensus validation tests to use the correct expected validator for each block
- Fixed test assumptions about validator ordering in HashSet

### 2. Added Comprehensive Tests to aura-ledger ✅

#### blockchain.rs (17 tests):
- Block creation and hashing
- Merkle root calculations (empty, single, multiple, odd number, power of two)
- Genesis block handling
- Chain configuration
- Block serialization
- Timestamp handling
- Validator differences

#### consensus.rs (14 tests):
- PoA initialization and validator management
- Validator addition/removal with edge cases
- Block validator rotation logic
- Block validation (valid, wrong validator, wrong hash, invalid signature)
- Transaction validation
- Block signing

#### did_registry.rs (14 tests):
- DID registration and duplicate prevention
- DID updates with ownership verification
- DID deactivation and reactivation prevention
- DID resolution
- Active status tracking
- Document hash changes on updates

#### transaction.rs (16 tests):
- Transaction creation with auto-generated IDs
- Transaction verification (valid, wrong signature, expired)
- All transaction types (RegisterDid, UpdateDid, DeactivateDid, RegisterSchema, UpdateRevocationList)
- Serialization/deserialization
- Chain ID handling
- Nonce for replay protection
- Complex schema transactions

### 3. Test Count Summary

| Crate | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| aura-common | 64 | ✅ 100% Complete |
| aura-crypto | 72 | ✅ 100% Complete |
| aura-ledger | 61 | ✅ All Passing (4/7 modules tested) |
| **Total** | **197** | **All Passing** |

## Technical Issues Resolved

1. **HashSet Ordering**: Fixed non-deterministic validator selection by sorting validators by their public key bytes
2. **Type Mismatches**: Updated all test helper functions to match actual type definitions
3. **Missing Traits**: Added necessary derives to core types for test assertions

## Remaining Work

### aura-ledger (3 modules remaining):
- `revocation_registry.rs`
- `storage.rs` 
- `vc_schema_registry.rs`

### Other crates:
- aura-wallet-core: All 5 modules
- aura-node: 9 modules

## Next Steps

1. Continue adding tests to the remaining aura-ledger modules
2. Move on to aura-wallet-core tests
3. Complete aura-node test coverage
4. Run coverage report to verify 100% coverage

## Time Invested

- Fixing compilation issues: ~30 minutes
- Debugging consensus tests: ~20 minutes
- Total session: ~50 minutes

## Achievement

Successfully fixed all aura-ledger test compilation issues and now have 197 passing tests across the project!
