# Memory Update - Configuration Migration

## Date: 2025-05-31

## Summary

Following the completion of high-priority fixes, I was asked to move the `config.toml` file to a permanent location for future users' installations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Directory Structure
- Created `config/` directory for all configuration files
- Moved `config.toml` from project root to `config/config.toml`
- Created `config/config.example.toml` as a template for users
- Added `config/README.md` with usage instructions

### 2. Code Updates
- Updated `aura-node/src/main.rs`:
  - Changed default config path from `"config.toml"` to `"config/config.toml"`
  - Line 19: Updated the clap default_value

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated `.gitignore`:
  - Changed from ignoring `config.toml` to `config/config.toml`
  - Ensures example config is tracked but actual config is not
- Updated `README.md`:
  - Added first-time setup instruction to copy example config
  - Added documentation for custom config file option
  - Shows: `cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml`

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- New users now have a clear example config to start with
- Actual config files are not tracked in git (security)
- Config files are organized in a dedicated directory
- Users can still override with `--config` flag

## Technical Details

The node's config loading logic (in `aura-node/src/config.rs`) already handles:
- Creating parent directories if they don't exist
- Loading existing config or creating default if missing
- Pretty-printing TOML format

## Build Status

Note: The project currently has RocksDB compilation issues (unrelated to these changes). Once resolved, the new config path will be active.

## Next Steps

1. Once build issues are resolved, test the new config path
2. Consider adding config validation
3. Consider environment variable support for config overrides
