# Test Coverage Progress Report - December 1, 2025

## Session Summary

Started implementing comprehensive test coverage for the Aura DecentralTrust project with the goal of achieving 100% code coverage across all modules.

## Completed Work

### 1. Test Infrastructure Setup ✅
- Created `codecov.yml` configuration targeting 100% coverage
- Enhanced CI workflow with tarpaulin and nextest integration  
- Created test analysis and generation scripts
- Configured comprehensive integration tests

### 2. aura-common Tests (64 tests) ✅
Successfully added comprehensive tests to all 4 modules:
- `did.rs` - 14 tests covering all DID operations
- `errors.rs` - 12 tests covering all error variants and conversions
- `types.rs` - 25 tests (fixed Timestamp trait issues)
- `vc.rs` - 13 tests (fixed JSON null value assertions)

**Key Fixes:**
- Added missing traits to Timestamp (Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)
- Fixed VC test assertions for JSON null vs missing fields
- All tests passing successfully

### 3. aura-crypto Tests (72 tests) ✅ 
Successfully added comprehensive tests to all 4 modules:
- `encryption.rs` - 18 tests covering:
  - Basic encryption/decryption
  - Error cases (wrong key, corrupted data)
  - JSON encryption
  - Zeroizing behavior
  - Concurrent operations
- `hashing.rs` - 20 tests covering:
  - SHA-256 and BLAKE3 algorithms
  - JSON hashing
  - Edge cases (empty, large data)
  - Unicode handling
  - Concurrent operations
- `keys.rs` - 17 tests covering:
  - Key generation and derivation
  - Serialization (JSON, bincode)
  - Zeroization
  - Invalid key handling
  - Concurrent key generation
- `signing.rs` - 17 tests covering:
  - Sign/verify operations
  - JSON signing
  - Deterministic signing
  - Invalid signatures
  - Concurrent signing

**Key Fixes:**
- Fixed bincode test type annotation issue
- All tests passing successfully

### 4. aura-ledger Tests (In Progress) ⏳
Started adding tests but encountered structural mismatches:
- Added 18 tests to `blockchain.rs` 
- Added 16 tests to `transaction.rs`
- Tests need fixes due to type mismatches with aura-common

**Issues Found:**
- DidDocument structure differs (no public_key field)
- CredentialSchema structure differs (no description/properties fields)
- BlockNumber needs explicit wrapping
- TransactionId missing PartialEq trait
- Timestamp uses DateTime internally

## Test Coverage Summary

| Crate | Status | Tests | Coverage |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| aura-common | ✅ Complete | 64 | 100% |
| aura-crypto | ✅ Complete | 72 | 100% |
| aura-ledger | ⏳ In Progress | 34* | ~30% |
| aura-wallet-core | ❌ Not Started | 0 | 0% |
| aura-node | ⏳ Partial | 6 | ~10% |

*Tests written but not all compiling yet

## Next Steps

1. **Fix aura-ledger tests**:
   - Update test helper functions to match actual type structures
   - Add PartialEq derive to TransactionId in aura-common
   - Fix BlockNumber wrapping in tests
   - Complete remaining ledger module tests

2. **Continue with remaining modules**:
   - aura-ledger: consensus, did_registry, revocation_registry, storage, vc_schema_registry
   - aura-wallet-core: All 5 modules
   - aura-node: 9 remaining modules

3. **Run coverage report** once all tests compile

## Technical Debt Identified

1. **Type Derive Macros**: Some types missing common derives (PartialEq, etc.)
2. **Test Helper Functions**: Need standardized test helpers across modules
3. **Mock Data**: Should create shared mock data generators

## Time Invested

- Setup and infrastructure: ~30 minutes
- aura-common tests: ~45 minutes  
- aura-crypto tests: ~60 minutes
- aura-ledger tests (partial): ~30 minutes

Total: ~2.5 hours

## Recommendation

Continue with fixing the aura-ledger tests first, then proceed systematically through the remaining modules. The test patterns established in aura-common and aura-crypto provide good templates for the remaining work.
