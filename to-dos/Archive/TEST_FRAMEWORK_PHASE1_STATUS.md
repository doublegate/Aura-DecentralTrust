# Test Framework Phase 1 Status Report
Date: June 1, 2025

## Overview
The aura-tests crate has been successfully fixed and all compilation issues resolved. The test framework is now functional with 74 passing tests out of 78 total tests.

## Test Framework Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 78
- **Passing Tests**: 74 (94.9%)
- **Ignored Tests**: 4 (CLI tests requiring binary)
- **Failed Tests**: 0

## Placeholder Implementations and TODOs

### 1. Revocation Registry Integration
The test framework reveals that the revocation registry integration is incomplete:
- Credential IDs cannot be directly checked for revocation
- Need mapping between credentials and revocation list entries
- Revocation transactions are created but not processed through blockchain

### 2. Storage Integration 
Tests simulate storage operations but note that a proper key-value store is needed for:
- Encrypted private key storage
- Credential storage
- General persistent data

### 3. CLI Testing
Four CLI tests are disabled because they require the compiled binary:
- Help flag functionality
- Version display
- Config error handling  
- Node lifecycle management

### 4. API Test Infrastructure
Several API tests skip execution when the node isn't running. Need:
- Test harness to start node before tests
- Proper test environment setup
- Integration test coordination

### 5. Benchmarking
Performance benchmarks are implemented but not integrated:
- Crypto operation benchmarks
- Ledger operation benchmarks
- Wallet operation benchmarks
- Need to add bench feature to Cargo.toml

### 6. Missing Core Methods
Tests revealed missing methods that were worked around:
- `Transaction::validate()` - needs implementation
- `Transaction::is_expired()` - manually checked in tests
- `KeyPair::from_parts()` - doesn't exist
- Limited PrivateKey operations (no cloning or direct PublicKey conversion)

## What Was Successfully Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Integration tests for all major workflows
- Property-based testing with proptest
- Unit tests for cross-crate functionality
- API and CLI test frameworks

### 2. Test Infrastructure
- Organized module structure
- Consistent test helpers
- Mock data generation
- Async test support

### 3. Property Tests
- DID roundtrip properties
- Encryption/decryption invariants
- Signing/verification properties
- Transaction properties
- Hash function properties
- Merkle tree properties

### 4. Integration Tests
- Complete DID lifecycle
- Verifiable credential workflows
- Multi-identity wallet management
- Multi-validator consensus
- Cross-crate encryption
- Transaction validation pipeline

## Remaining Work for Complete Test Framework

1. **Enable CLI Tests**: Build binary in CI before running tests
2. **Add Benchmark Feature**: Configure Cargo.toml for benchmarking
3. **Implement Test Harness**: Auto-start node for API tests
4. **Add Missing Methods**: Implement validate() and other missing functionality
5. **Complete Revocation Integration**: Proper credential-to-revocation mapping

## Conclusion

The test framework is functional and provides good coverage of the existing functionality. The placeholder implementations and TODOs are primarily in integration points between components rather than core functionality gaps. This aligns with the overall Phase 1 completion status where the remaining work is primarily wiring components together rather than implementing new functionality.
