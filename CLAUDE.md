# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Aura is a decentralized identity and trust network that combines Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enable self-sovereign identity and user-controlled data management.

## Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1. **Aura Ledger** (`aura-ledger`) - A specialized DLT for DIDs and credential metadata (Rust)
2. **Aura Identity Wallets** (`aura-wallet-core`) - User agents for managing identity and credentials (Rust core + JS/TS frontend)
3. **Aura Nodes** (`aura-node`) - Network participants maintaining the ledger (Rust)
4. **Off-Chain Storage** - User-controlled encrypted storage for actual credentials and PII

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (install from https://rustup.rs)
- C/C++ development tools (gcc, gcc-c++, clang)
- System libraries:
  - rocksdb-devel (RocksDB database) - **REQUIRED for main branch**
  - libzstd-devel (zstd compression)
  - clang/clang-devel (for bindgen)
  - Development headers for C standard library

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/doublegate/Aura-DecentralTrust
cd Aura-DecentralTrust

# Install system dependencies first (Fedora/RHEL/Bazzite):
sudo dnf install -y rocksdb-devel libzstd-devel clang-devel

# Standard build with system RocksDB:
ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib64 LIBROCKSDB_SYS_DISABLE_BUNDLED=1 cargo build --release

# If you still have bindgen/clang issues:
BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS="-I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/15/include" \
ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib64 \
LIBROCKSDB_SYS_DISABLE_BUNDLED=1 \
cargo build --release

# For Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install -y librocksdb-dev libzstd-dev clang
ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib LIBROCKSDB_SYS_DISABLE_BUNDLED=1 cargo build --release
```

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Core Components**: Written in Rust for performance and memory safety
- **Wallet Frontend**: JavaScript/TypeScript with React Native
- **Cross-Platform**: Rust core compiled to WASM for browser/mobile use
- **Cryptography**: Ed25519/ECDSA for signing, AES-GCM for encryption
- **P2P Networking**: libp2p for node communication
- **Standards**: W3C DIDs and Verifiable Credentials
- **Database**: RocksDB for persistent storage (main branch)

## Important Implementation Notes

- The ledger stores NO personal data - only DIDs, hashes, and metadata
- All PII and credentials are stored off-chain with user-controlled encryption
- Initial consensus will use Proof-of-Authority, later transitioning to Proof-of-Stake
- ZKP integration is planned for Phase 2 using libraries like arkworks-rs or bellman

## Recent Updates (2025-06-01 Evening)

### v0.1.5 Release (6:45 PM)
Released version 0.1.5 with comprehensive test coverage:
- **Version**: v0.1.5 (tagged and pushed)
- **Release Workflow**: Triggered for multi-platform binary builds
- **Documentation**: Updated README, CHANGELOG, and test coverage reports

### Test Coverage Completion (4:12 PM)
Successfully completed comprehensive test coverage for the entire project:
- **Total Tests**: 505 (ALL PASSING) - up from 452
- **Coverage**: 95% across all crates
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, property-based tests, performance benchmarks
- **Key Fixes**: Resolved 17 failing aura-node tests
- **Documentation**: Created TEST_COVERAGE_FINAL_2025-06-01.md and MASTER_PHASE1-REAL_IMP.md
- **Remaining Work**: 5% API-blockchain integration documented (9-15 days)

### Important Development Practice
**Tests should now be written alongside new features** rather than as a separate phase. This ensures better code quality, immediate validation, and continuous integration compliance.

## Recent Updates (2025-06-01 Morning)

### Dependency Updates
The project has been updated to work with latest dependencies:
- **bincode**: Updated to 2.0 with new encode/decode API
- **libp2p**: Updated to 0.55.0 with new NetworkBehaviour macro syntax
- **axum**: Updated to 0.8.4 with new serve API
- **All other deps**: Updated to latest versions as of 2025-05-30

### Build Requirements
- **RocksDB**: Requires rocksdb-devel system package and environment variables
- **Clang**: Required for bindgen to generate RocksDB bindings
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR`: Path to system RocksDB libraries
  - `LIBROCKSDB_SYS_DISABLE_BUNDLED=1`: Use system RocksDB instead of bundled
  - `BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS`: May be needed for clang headers

### Security Features Implemented

# Run with TLS (generates certificates)
ROCKSDB_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib64 LIBROCKSDB_SYS_DISABLE_BUNDLED=1 cargo run --bin aura-node -- --enable-tls

# Get auth token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login \
