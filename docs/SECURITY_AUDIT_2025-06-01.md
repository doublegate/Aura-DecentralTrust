# Security Audit Report - June 1, 2025

**Project**: Aura DecentralTrust v0.1.0  
**Date**: June 1, 2025  
**Auditor**: Security Review Process  
**Status**: **REQUIRES FIXES** - Critical issues found

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was performed on the Aura DecentralTrust codebase following the v0.1.0 release. While the project demonstrates strong security fundamentals in cryptography and input validation, several critical issues must be addressed before production deployment.

**Overall Security Rating**: üü© **GOOD** (Critical and high priority issues resolved)

## Audit Results

### Dependency Scan
- **cargo-audit**: ‚úÖ **PASSED** - No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Total Dependencies**: 470 crates
- **Last Updated**: June 1, 2025

### Critical Findings

#### 1. **Hardcoded JWT Secret** üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Location**: `aura-node/src/auth.rs:11`
- **Issue**: JWT secret hardcoded as `b"aura-secret-key-change-in-production"`
- **Impact**: Anyone can forge valid authentication tokens
- **Fix Required**: Load from environment variable or secure config

#### 2. **Hardcoded Credentials** üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Location**: `aura-node/src/auth.rs:140-149`
- **Issue**: Test passwords hardcoded in source
- **Impact**: Known credentials if deployed to production
- **Fix Required**: Implement proper credential storage

### High Priority Findings

1. **Missing P2P Message Size Limits** üü†
   - Risk of DoS via large messages
   - Need size validation before deserialization

2. **Unsafe unwrap() Usage** üü†
   - Multiple locations using unwrap()/expect()
   - Can cause panics and service disruption

3. **Rate Limiting Not Implemented** üü†
   - Constants defined but not enforced
   - Vulnerable to brute force attacks

### Medium Priority Findings

1. **Weak TLS Configuration**
   - No mutual TLS authentication
   - Consider for node-to-node communication

2. **Incomplete SSRF Protection**
   - URL validation missing some private IP ranges
   - IPv6 ranges not blocked

3. **Transaction Signatures Not Verified**
   - API accepts but doesn't verify signatures
   - Could allow unsigned transactions

4. **Memory Handling in Encryption**
   - Creates unnecessary plaintext copies
   - Sensitive data lingers in memory

### Positive Security Features ‚úÖ

1. **Excellent Cryptography**
   - Proper use of Zeroize trait
   - Modern algorithms (Ed25519, AES-GCM)
   - No custom crypto implementations

2. **Comprehensive Input Validation**
   - Regex patterns for DIDs, URLs
   - Size limits on requests (1MB)
   - Type validation on all inputs

3. **Replay Protection**
   - Transactions include nonces
   - Chain ID verification
   - Expiration timestamps

4. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent use of Result types
   - No unsafe code blocks
   - Proper error propagation

5. **Security Headers**
   - JWT authentication on all endpoints
   - TLS/HTTPS support available
   - Request size limits

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before ANY Production Use)
1. Replace hardcoded JWT secret with secure configuration
2. Remove all hardcoded credentials
3. Implement P2P message size validation

### Short-term Improvements (Next Release)
1. Implement rate limiting middleware
2. Fix all unwrap()/expect() usage
3. Verify transaction signatures
4. Enhance SSRF protections

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Mutual TLS for node communication
2. Comprehensive audit logging
3. Certificate pinning for P2P
4. HSM integration for keys

## Code Quality Observations

- **Memory Safety**: Excellent use of Rust's safety features
- **Concurrency**: Proper use of Arc<Mutex<>> patterns
- **Dependencies**: All up-to-date, no known vulnerabilities
- **Testing**: Good test coverage for security functions

## Compliance Readiness

- **GDPR**: ‚úÖ No PII stored on-chain
- **Data Protection**: ‚úÖ Encryption for sensitive data
- **Access Control**: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Needs improvement (hardcoded secrets)
- **Audit Trail**: ‚ùå Not implemented

## Conclusion

The Aura DecentralTrust project has a solid security foundation with excellent cryptographic implementations and good coding practices. However, the hardcoded secrets represent a **CRITICAL** vulnerability that must be fixed before any production deployment.

With the recommended fixes implemented, this codebase would meet security standards for a production decentralized identity platform.

## Action Items

1. **DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until critical fixes are complete
2. Review `security_fixes_needed.md` for prioritized fix list
3. Implement environment-based configuration
4. Schedule follow-up audit after fixes
