- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline

#### Remaining Tasks (5%)
1. **API-Blockchain Integration** (1-2 days)
   - Connect endpoints to actual ledger operations
   - Remove mock data responses

2. **P2P Message Handlers** (2-3 days)
   - Implement block propagation
   - Add transaction broadcasting
   - Enable node synchronization

3. **Desktop Wallet MVP** (2-4 weeks)
   - UI/UX design
   - Tauri integration
   - Core functionality implementation

## Technical Environment

### Build Configuration
- **Rust**: 1.70+ with 2021 edition
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - rand: 0.8.5 (downgraded for compatibility)
  - ed25519-dalek: 2.1.1
  - libp2p: 0.55.0
  - rocksdb: 0.23.0
  - axum: 0.8.4

### CI/CD Status
- **Build**: üü° In Progress (awaiting latest fixes)
- **Tests**: ‚úÖ Passing locally
- **Security**: ‚úÖ Audit configured
- **Coverage**: ‚è≥ Pending setup verification

## Known Issues & Resolutions

### Resolved Today
1. **rand_core version conflict**: Downgraded rand to 0.8.5
2. **getrandom js feature**: Changed to wasm_js for v0.3.x
3. **Clippy warnings**: Updated all format strings
4. **CI configuration**: Fixed audit and dependabot configs

### Pending Verification
1. CI pipeline success with all fixes
2. Code coverage report generation
3. Release workflow functionality

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Verify CI/CD pipeline success
2. Create v0.1.0 release tag if CI passes
3. Begin API-blockchain integration

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Complete API-blockchain integration
2. Implement P2P message handlers
3. Start desktop wallet planning

### Medium Term (This Month)
1. Desktop wallet MVP development
2. Testnet preparation
3. Documentation improvements
4. Community setup

## Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Clippy Warnings**: 0
- **Format Issues**: 0
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 0 critical, 0 high
- **Test Coverage**: ~40% (improving)

### Development Velocity
- **Commits Today**: 8+
- **Issues Resolved**: 6 CI/CD related
- **PRs Merged**: 2 (Dependabot)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Build environment issues (resolved)
- Dependency conflicts (managed)
- CI/CD setup (nearly complete)

### Medium Risk
- Timeline for desktop wallet MVP
- Test coverage improvement needed
- Documentation gaps for new contributors

### Mitigation Strategies
- Continuous CI/CD monitoring
- Incremental test additions
- Documentation sprint planned

## Conclusion

Significant progress was made today in stabilizing the CI/CD pipeline and resolving dependency issues. The project remains on track for Phase 1 completion, with only API integration and P2P handlers remaining before moving to the desktop wallet implementation.

The development environment is now stable with all local builds passing and CI/CD infrastructure in place. Focus can shift back to feature completion once CI validation is confirmed.
