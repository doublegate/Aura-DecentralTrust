- **Transaction Types**: DID operations, schema registration, revocation updates
- **Storage Layer**: RocksDB-based persistent storage with column families
- **Registries**:
  - DID Registry: Create, update, deactivate DIDs
  - VC Schema Registry: Register credential schemas
  - Revocation Registry: Manage credential revocation lists

### 3. **Core Cryptography (aura-crypto)** ✅
- **Signing**: Ed25519 signatures for DIDs and transactions
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for secure credential storage
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 and Blake3 for data integrity
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation and storage

### 4. **Common Types (aura-common)** ✅
W3C-compliant implementations of:
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Full DID document structure
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: Claims, proofs, and metadata
- **Verifiable Presentations (VPs)**: Selective disclosure support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types

### 5. **Wallet Core (aura-wallet-core)** ✅
Complete identity wallet implementation:
- **Key Manager**: Password-based key derivation and encryption
- **DID Manager**: Create and manage DIDs with proper key associations
- **VC Store**: Encrypted credential storage with search capabilities
- **Presentation Generator**: Create full and selective disclosure presentations
- **WASM Support**: Ready for browser/mobile compilation

### 6. **Network Node (aura-node)** ✅
Full node implementation with:
- **P2P Networking**: libp2p-based gossip network
- **Block Production**: Validator nodes can produce blocks
- **REST API**: Query DIDs, schemas, and submit transactions
- **Configuration**: TOML-based configuration system
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line arguments for node operation

### 7. **Examples and Tests** ✅
- **Basic Usage Example**: Complete credential lifecycle demonstration
- **Integration Tests**: Test coverage for core functionality
- **Documentation**: README and API documentation

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users have complete control over their DIDs and keys
2. **W3C Standards Compliance**: DIDs and VCs follow official specifications
3. **Privacy by Design**: Credentials stored encrypted, selective disclosure supported
4. **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure or control
5. **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability

## Technical Achievements

- **Performance**: Efficient blockchain operations with RocksDB
- **Security**: Proper cryptographic primitives and key management
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports future enhancements
- **Interoperability**: Standards-based approach for ecosystem compatibility

## Usage Examples

### Creating a DID:
```rust
let mut wallet = AuraWallet::new();
wallet.initialize("password")?;
let (did, did_document, key_pair) = wallet.create_did()?;
```

### Issuing a Credential:
```rust
let credential = VerifiableCredential::new(
    issuer_did,
    holder_did,
    vec!["UniversityDegreeCredential"],
    claims,
);
```

### Creating a Presentation:
```rust
let presentation = wallet.create_presentation(
    &holder_did,
    credential_ids,
    challenge,
    domain,
)?;
```
