# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-01  
**Status**: ✅ **v0.1.0 Released!**

## Overview

Phase 1 of the Aura project is 98% complete with the successful release of v0.1.0 on June 1, 2025 and completion of Phase 1B (API-blockchain integration) on June 2, 2025. All core infrastructure has been implemented, tested, secured, and packaged for multi-platform distribution. The API layer is now fully connected to the blockchain backend. Only the desktop wallet MVP remains to complete Phase 1.

## Completed Components

### 1. **Rust Workspace Structure** ✅
- Created modular workspace with 5 core crates

- **Block Production**: Validator nodes can produce blocks
- **REST API**: Query DIDs, schemas, and submit transactions
- **Configuration**: TOML-based configuration system
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line arguments for node operation

### 7. **Examples and Tests** ✅
- **Basic Usage Example**: Complete credential lifecycle demonstration
- **Integration Tests**: Test coverage for core functionality
- **Documentation**: README and API documentation

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users have complete control over their DIDs and keys
2. **W3C Standards Compliance**: DIDs and VCs follow official specifications
3. **Privacy by Design**: Credentials stored encrypted, selective disclosure supported
4. **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure or control
5. **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability

## Technical Achievements

- **Performance**: Efficient blockchain operations with RocksDB
- **Security**: Proper cryptographic primitives and key management
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports future enhancements
- **Interoperability**: Standards-based approach for ecosystem compatibility

## Usage Examples

### Creating a DID:
```rust
let mut wallet = AuraWallet::new();
wallet.initialize("password")?;
let (did, did_document, key_pair) = wallet.create_did()?;
```

### Issuing a Credential:
```rust
let credential = VerifiableCredential::new(
    issuer_did,
    holder_did,
    vec!["UniversityDegreeCredential"],
    claims,
);
```

### Creating a Presentation:
```rust
let presentation = wallet.create_presentation(
    &holder_did,
    credential_ids,
    challenge,
    domain,
)?;
```
